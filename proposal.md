Game Mechanics:
Player can sign-in using a username or start a game.
Each player can have 3 useable pokemon that he/she has to catch.
These pokemon will be shown upon log-in. New players will be given a choice for their first pokemon.
A button, Random encounter, will be available for the player to fight pokemon. 
The player can either catch the pokemon or defeat it to train. 
When a player defeats a pokemon, the player's pokemon will gain experience. 
Also, depending on the pokemon defeated, the player's pokemon will gain 'Effort Values', which will aid in the growth of a certain stat of the pokemon.
A pokemon has four stats: Attack, Defense, Speed, HP. 
	Attack, determines how much damage the pokemon can do.
	Defense, determins how well a pokemon can take an attack
	Speed, determines which of the two pokemon attacks first
	HP, is how many life points the pokemon has
The actual stat is based on the level of the pokemon. A pokemon can be 1-20 level. 20 being the highest. 
Pokemon can also evolve. When a pokemon becomes a certain level, the pokemon can evolve and gain better stats.
The game will contain 16 pokemon.

Technical:
The player will be on the client side, while the game mechanics will be handled by a server.
Two clients can fight each other via the server
